## Problem 1: NY NOAA Data

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("ny_noaa")
```

The data has observations on 2595176 individual GHCND-Daily weather
stations. The data set has 7 variables some of which include the station
ID, the date of the observation, the precipitation in tenths of a mm,
the snowfall in mm, the snow depth in mm, and the max and temperature in
degrees Celsius. Missing data is a big issue considering there are
3387623 missing data in the set.

``` r
ny_noaa_clean = 
   ny_noaa |>
separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep="-", extra = "merge", fill = "right")|>
   mutate(
      prcp = round(as.numeric(prcp, digits =0)),
      tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10,
      tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10,
      snow = as.numeric(snow),
      year = as.factor(year),
      month = as.numeric(month),
      day = as.numeric(day))
```

``` r
   ny_noaa_clean|>
  group_by(snow) |> summarize(count = n(), na.rm=TRUE) |> arrange(desc(count)) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 282 × 3
    ##     snow   count na.rm
    ##    <dbl>   <int> <lgl>
    ##  1     0 2008508 TRUE 
    ##  2    NA  381221 TRUE 
    ##  3    25   31022 TRUE 
    ##  4    13   23095 TRUE 
    ##  5    51   18274 TRUE 
    ##  6    76   10173 TRUE 
    ##  7     8    9962 TRUE 
    ##  8     5    9748 TRUE 
    ##  9    38    9197 TRUE 
    ## 10     3    8790 TRUE 
    ## # ℹ 272 more rows

The most common observed value for snow is function (x, …, wt = NULL,
sort = FALSE, name = NULL) mm. This could be due to many reasons,
including because the half of the stations report precipitation only and
the record length of the stations are not consistent which might result
in some winter months being excluded.

``` r
t_max_july =
   ny_noaa_clean |> 
   filter(month==07) |>

   summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE))|>

    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none")
```

The structure of the data is tidy but not for a lay audience. This is
noticeable based on the dense overlay of stations. In July there is one
clear outlier in the 1988 and another in January in 1982. The structure
of the data is somewhat interpretable, it might be best to group by the
location of the station as opposed to the station ID to clean up the
aesthetics.

## Problem 2:Accelerometers

``` r
nhanes_demo = read_csv("./nhanes_covar.csv", 
                       skip=4, 
                       na = c(".", "NA", ""),
col_types=cols(
      `SEQN` = col_character(),
      `sex` = col_character(),
      `age`= col_number(),
      `BMI`=col_factor(),
      `education`=col_character()
      
      ))|>
   
   janitor::clean_names()
   
nhanes_acce=read_csv("./nhanes_accel.csv", na = c(".", "NA", ""),
col_types=cols(
      `SEQN` = col_character()))|>
   janitor::clean_names()

full_nhanes = left_join(nhanes_acce, nhanes_demo, by = "seqn") |>
   drop_na(seqn, sex, age, bmi, education) |>
   filter( age > 21)|>
   mutate(
      sex=recode(sex, '1' = "Male", '2' = "Female"),
      education = recode(education, '1' = "LessHS", '2' = "HS", '3' = "HSMore")
   )
```

``` r
full_nhanes |>
   drop_na(education)|>
  group_by(education, sex) |>
  summarize(count = n())|>
   pivot_wider(
       names_from = sex,
       values_from = count)  |>
   knitr::kable(caption= "Number of Men and Women per Education Category")
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| education | Female | Male |
|:----------|-------:|-----:|
| HS        |     23 |   34 |
| HSMore    |     59 |   54 |
| LessHS    |     28 |   27 |

Number of Men and Women per Education Category

``` r
menvwomen_plot=
full_nhanes |>
  drop_na(education)|>
  group_by(education, sex) |>
ggplot(aes(x = age, y = education, fill =sex)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(alpha=.5, scale=0.85, color = "blue") +
   labs(
      title = "Age Distributions of Men and Women by Education Levels",
      x = "Age",
      y = "Education Level")
```

For participants with an education level of less than high school, there
is a slightly bimodal age distribution for men, and a unimodal one for
females that is left-skewed. For participants with an education level
higher than high school, there is a prominent right-skewed age
distribution for females and a slightly bimodal age distribution for
males. For participants with a high school equivalent level of
education, there is a left-skewed age distribution for females and a
slightly bimodal age distribution for men.

``` r
activity_plots=
   full_nhanes |>
  mutate(
     total_activity = as.numeric(rowSums(pick(min1:min1440), na.rm = TRUE)))|>
   ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_activity))+
   geom_point(aes(color=sex), alpha=.5)+
   geom_smooth(aes(color=sex),se=FALSE)+
   labs(
      title = "Activity Levels Across Age for Males and Females by Education Level",
      x = "Age",
      y = "Total Activity")+
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))+
   facet_wrap(~education)
```

This plot demonstrates higher levels of activity in younger females with
a high school level education compared to males. Additionally, for
individuals with high school level of education and higher, females
generally had higher levels of activity. The group where this pattern
diverges is for those with less than high school level of education.

``` r
daily_plots =
   full_nhanes |>
   
   pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min"),  
                 names_to = "minute", 
                 values_to = "activity") |>
   
    mutate(minute = as.numeric(sub("min", "", minute)))|>
   
   ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = activity, color=sex))+
   geom_smooth(aes(color=sex), alpha=.3)+
   labs(
      title = "24-Hour Activity Time Courses by Education Level and Sex",
      x = "Minute of the Day",
      y = "Total Activity")+
   facet_wrap(~education)+
   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Based on the created plots, most people have higher levels of activity
in the middle minutes of the day which makes sense becasue the early
minutes are midnight and beyond. There are no major differences between
education groups and for most except, the group with less than a high
school level of education, females have higher levels of activity
throughout the day.
